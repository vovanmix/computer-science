# Heap is a binary tree, where all childs' keys should be less (or bigger) that their parents'.
# Heaps are filled in order, top to bottom and left to right
# When we add a new value, we compare it's key to it's parent's, and if it doesn't fit in the structure, 
# we swap it with the parent, and then with it's parent
# Min heap: lowest key at the top, Max heap: biggest key at the top
# Very useful for implementing Priority queues
