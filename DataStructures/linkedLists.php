# Linked list is a group of elements, each of them have a link (poiner, reference) to the next (linked list) 
# and previous (double linked list) element. Elements can not be accessed by index. Elemets are accessed only in consequence.
# Lists are better than arrays in adding elements (faster in memory). But is lists are implemented using arrays there is no difference.
# Linear Search complexity: O(n) (arrays are better( O(log n)) in binary search)
